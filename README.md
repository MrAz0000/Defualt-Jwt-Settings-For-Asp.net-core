> Make sure you have the following section in your `appsettings.json`:

```json
"Jwt": {
  "Key": "your_secret_key_here",
  "Issuer": "your_app",
  "Audience": "your_users"
}
```

## Running the Project

1. Clone the repo

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MrAz0000/Defualt-Jwt-Settings-For-Asp.net-core.git
   ```

2. Open in Visual Studio or run:

   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

3. Use Swagger or Postman to test protected endpoints (if any are added).

---

## Token Generation

This template **does not** include token generation logic by default. You can add a controller like `AuthController.cs` to issue JWTs using `JwtSecurityTokenHandler`.

---

## Notes

* You can extend this setup with role-based authorization, refresh tokens, or identity integration.
* Always store secret keys securely (use user-secrets, environment variables, or Azure Key Vault in production).

Would you like me to also include a basic `AuthController.cs` with JWT token generation?
